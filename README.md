# Placenta-Hyperoxia-Experiment
Programs to performa statistical analysis of FD-DOS data vs clinical data. 
Include: 
1) Analyze the intraclass correlation coefficient of placental StO2, HbT, and HbO2 in reproducibility test.
2) Analyze the mean and standard deviation of palcental StO2, HbT, and HbO2 in stability test.
3) Analyze the absolute values of placental StO2, HbT, and HbO2 during baseline measurements (mean of last 4 frames measurements in baseline).
4) Analyze the DeltaStO2, DeltaHbT, and DeltaHbO2 in response to maternal hyperoxia. Find out the delta changes by searching the maximum StO2 during the hyperoxia. Note, a 4-frame-window is used to smooth the data. 
5) statistically analyze the association between 24 subjects placenta hemodynamics and APO or MVM.
